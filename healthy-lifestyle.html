<p>
    Good nutrition is vital for maintaining overall health and well-being. Eating a balanced 
    diet that includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can 
    provide your body with the essential nutrients it needs to function at its best. Avoiding 
    excessive sugar and processed foods can also help manage weight and reduce the risk of 
    chronic diseases.

<h2>Exercise</h2>

<p>
    Regular physical activity is key to staying healthy. Exercise improves cardiovascular health, 
    strengthens muscles, and helps maintain flexibility. A combination of aerobic activities (such 
    as walking or cycling) and strength training can improve overall fitness. Aim for at least 30 
    minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week.

<p>
    Getting enough quality sleep is essential for both physical and mental health. Adults should 
    aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Good sleep hygiene, such as maintaining a regular 
    sleep schedule and creating a relaxing bedtime routine, can improve sleep quality and help

<p>
    Taking care of your mental health is just as important as caring for your body. Practicing 
    mindfulness, reducing stress, and seeking support from friends, family, or a professional 
    can help maintain emotional balance. Regular physical activity can also improve mood and 
    reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression.
</p>

<h2>Hydration</h2>

<p>
    Staying hydrated is vital for every cell in your body. Drinking enough water helps maintain 
    energy levels, supports digestion, and aids in the transportation of nutrients. It is 
    recommended to drink at least 8 glasses of water per day, but individual needs can vary 
    based on activity levels and climate.
